Dataset about The Barbie Cinematographic Universe

Childhood to Generations. Barbie is one of the most important symbols on western contemporary society´s transformations, since the way she picks up her new career or a new look. It´s true for us and her multiverse is something on its own.

I´ve loved the Barbie Movies that came on my time growing up, many of them made me dream bigger, be a kinder human being and a curious thinker. *Between her many careers, Barbie helped me choose my own professional path, it´s undeniable.*
## *Have fun creating with this dataset.*
Since my start on data, I couldn´t find some structured quality data of her, so I needed to make on my own. After all, Barbie can be all she wants, even data.

Dataset made by me with WebScrapping Techniques, such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium
